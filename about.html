		<h2>Yellow-ColdPlay</h2>
			<p>ColdPlay is going to rock the world!</p>
			<p>Just you wait and see...</p>
			<p>Look at the Stars
			Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah' they were all Yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all Yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah' your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know? you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
Cos you were all Yellow</p>
